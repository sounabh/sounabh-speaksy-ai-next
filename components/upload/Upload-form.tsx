And finally I said, John Leslie, I'm bored, I don't want to play you anymore. And I got up, I said I'm ready to go to sleep now. John Leslie said no, you can't go now Dad. I said why? He said, it's not over until I win. That was his attitude. John Leslie won and he got up and he yawned and he said I'm ready to go to sleep now. And I'm saying to you, what if all of us took that attitude? The cause repossessed. Nobody believed in you. You've lost again and again and again. The lights are cut off but you're still looking at your dream, reviewing it every day and say to yourself, it's not over until I win." },

Feeling smug, I declared the game over and announced my intention to go to bed, only to be met with a resolute, 'No, Dad, it's not over until *I* win!'  This unwavering determination from my son, who then proceeded to finally win a game, leaving me exhausted but deeply impressed, got me thinking.  How often do we give up on our dreams, our businesses, our goals, the moment we face setbacks?  How often do we let the repossession notice, the string of failures, the dark room with no electricity extinguish the fire within us? John Leslie's simple yet profound statement, 'It's not over until I win,' encapsulates the incredible power of perseverance.  Itâ€™s a reminder that true success isn't solely defined by the absence of failure, but by the unwavering commitment to keep fighting, keep striving, keep believing, until the final victory is achieved. This isn't just about games; it's a life lesson that applies to every aspect of our lives â€“ a call to action to embrace that same spirit, to re-examine our goals with a renewed sense of resilience, and to remember that the race isn't over until we win, no matter how many times we've fallen before.\"\n}\n" },
